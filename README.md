## My first git steps
I coverd some basic commands including  

```
git status
```

Also together were:

```
git add <filename>
git commit -m "My message about changes here"
```

Also the useful

```
git checkout <commitID>
git dif <commitID> <commitID>
```

And for github
```
git push
git pull
git clone
```
